# credit_card_checker
The program takes in an array of credit card numbers.
Using the Luhn algorithm, a function verifies that each card number is valid or invalid, returning an array of the invalid numbers.
The invalid numbers are then run through another function to determine which companies' cards are included in the invalid cards array.
An array of card companies with invalid card numbers included in the original array is returned.
